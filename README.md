### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Alex Thoo, a Software Engineer. Passion, problem-solving, and technology are the driving forces behind my journey in the world of software engineering. I'm dedicated to crafting applications that leave a lasting impact. There's an unparalleled sense of satisfaction in unraveling intricate problems or transforming a concept into a fully operational application, and it's this feeling that fuels my passion for engineering. One of the most valuable lessons I've learned on this exciting path is the importance of embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth. I remind myself daily to be at ease with feeling uncomfortable, knowing that as long as I learn even just 1% more than I did the day before, I'm progressing towards becoming the developer I aspire to be. In my previous roles, I've had the privilege of wearing various hats. I began as a project analyst in the construction and tech industry, contributing to the creation of Apple Campus 2. Later, I transitioned to a project manager role within the IT sector, where I assisted clients in seamless cloud migration as an MSP.
